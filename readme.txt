#TODO: Refactor the code.

The program is verified to work with python3. 

Depending on your system, you might run the program in two ways:

# If Anaconda Python 3 installed:
python toru_assignment_1.py

# For other systems,
python3 toru_assignment_1.py


The input file is hardcoded, and can be found at the top portion of the program.

Just running the program will generate the output file.
It refreshes the content of the output file every-time the program runs.
Running the file will also show the number of sentences in the input file.

If you want to save the output for a particular input file, it is recommended that you change the file name in the code.
